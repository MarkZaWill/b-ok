<h1>Well, look at you, feeling pretty good</h1>

<div>Let's keep it up!</div>
<div>You could:</div>
<ul>
	
	<li>Talk to someone close to you.</li>
	<li>Go for a short walk outside</li>
	<li>Get exercise</li>
	<li>Play some games</li>
	<li>Get a snack or a meal</li>
	<li>Get ahead on work</li>
	<li>Clean (I know, but isn't a tidy space just the best feeling???)</li>
	<li>Learn a new skill like coding!</li>
	<li>Be helpful to someone who might not be feeling as good as you right now</li>
	<li>Listen to some good music</li>
</ul>
